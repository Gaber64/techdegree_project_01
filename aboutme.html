        <h2>Early Years</h2>
        <p>I was born on a snowy, cold morning in Nacogdoches, Texas. Which was weird because it hardly snows in Texas, let alone east texas.</p> <p>And it was may...</p>
        <p>Little did I know though, that's when it would all start. I spent the first twelve years of my life being a child, then abruptly, at thirteen, I was teenager. That went on for years and years until eighteen, I was this weird hybrid of a teenager and adult. Boy, life hit me like a freight train right in the face with that one. </p>

        <h2>The Other Years</h2>
        <p>Once I hit twenty, I was finally out of that crazy period where I was an adult and a child. The constant teasing because of it was finally over and I was a man. That was three years ago and not a whole lot has changed since then. I still get teased but thats for unrelated issues.</p> 
          
          <p>Inbetween then and now, a lot has happened. More than I can fit on this page.

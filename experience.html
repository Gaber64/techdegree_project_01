        <h2>Bruce Jenner Excellence</h2>
        <p>You're probably wondering what that picture of Bruce Jenner is all about. Since I don't have a whole lot of actual web design expierence, I wanted to give a visual representation of the level of excellence I'm going to bring to your company.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have spent the last several years with a few jobs. Below is a list of skills I have gathered from these experiences and how I feel like they will help me take your company and business to the next level. </p>
         <ul class="exp"> <li>Produce Team Member, Target </li> </ul>
          <p>I spent about 2 years working the produce section inside of a Target. Not only did it teach me how to manage my time to get everything done, I have a keen eye for health produce and produce like items. If you keep fruit in your breakroom or anything like that, I will make sure there is no bad looking produce and spend my free time culling through other peoples fruit and vegatables. We don't want any bad apples in the bunch.</p>
          <ul class="exp"><li>Various Restaurants</li></ul>
          <p>I won't bore you with listing out every restaurant I have ever worked at. Though there have been a few as I've been in and out of "business", like we like to call it, since I was 14. It has taught me many, many things. Like, how to multitask, how to control being overwhelmed, how to deliver great hospitality and service, despite someones attitude towards you, just to mention a few.</p> <p>I started washing dishes and worked my way up to bussing tables. From there, I ran the expo window and then moved onto serving. Learning valuable lessons along the way about working hard, working your way up, and putting in your dues. But most importantly, this will help me take care of everyone in the office. I'll walk around asking if everyone is doing alright, giving a thumbs up before they can answer. Refilling waters, and making sure everyone is enjoying their food. Questions like "Can I get you guys anything else, maybe some ketchup, salt pepper, hot sauces?" Come naturally to me. Nobody will have a bad dining expierence so long as I'm in the office. </p>
